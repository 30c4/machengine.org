These arenâ€™t Zig bindings to these libraries (which we have separately), but instead are just forks of the actual project with their build system replaced by build.zig so you can depend on them and build them using the Zig package manager.
Pure forks with build.zig:

Some are not usable yet/we expect their APIs to change substantially, while others are near promotion to being declared stable but have a few caveats.
While libraries are unstable, they live in the Mach monorepo. Once declared stable they will be exported to a separate standalone repository.
mach-sysaudio mach-sysaudio is a lightweight and cross-platform abstraction over various sound drivers, providing input and output.</description></item><item><title>mach-freetype: Ziggified FreeType 2 bindings</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/pkg/freetype/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/pkg/freetype/</guid><description>Zig bindings to FreeType and HarfBuzz, featuring:
