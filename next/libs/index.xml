Some are not usable yet/we expect their APIs to change substantially, while others are near promotion to being declared stable but have a few caveats.
While libraries are unstable, they live in the Mach monorepo. Once declared stable they will be exported to a separate standalone repository.
mach-sysaudio mach-sysaudio is a lightweight and cross-platform abstraction over various sound drivers, providing input and output.</description></item><item><title>mach-freetype: Ziggified FreeType 2 bindings</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/libs/freetype/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/libs/freetype/</guid><description>Zig bindings to FreeType and HarfBuzz, featuring:
