We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Mach for ~2 years now, primarily building out the Zig gamedev ecosystem, building foundational packages that we needed for Mach core, and as a result we&amp;rsquo;ve really just broken ground on the engine side of things.
Development is fairly linear, but developments that you see aren&amp;rsquo;t linear, we were focused on more foundational things before - but yoday we&amp;rsquo;re actively focused on higher-level APIs which will have more profound impacts for end-users.</description></item></channel></rss>
