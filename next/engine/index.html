We&rsquo;re optimistic about exploring other tooling which effectively produce data in simple & intuitive ways (think: why is developing games not as fun as playing them?)</p><h2 id=join-the-effort>Join the effort</h2><p>There is a ton of stuff to do, and we&rsquo;d love your help in making this a reality. :)</p><p>Join us <a href=https://discord.gg/XNG3NZgCqp>in Discord</a> to participate and keep up with the latest developments.</p></div><div class=toc><h3>Table of contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#modular>Modular</a></li><li><a href=#data--tooling-driven>Data & tooling-driven</a></li><li><a href=#join-the-effort>Join the effort</a></li></ul></nav></div></main><div class=footer><a href=https://hexops.com/privacy>Privacy matters</a><p><a href=https://machengine.org/next/about#improve-this-site>Improve this site</a> | <a href=https://github.com/sponsors/slimsag>Sponsor on GitHub</a> | <a href=https://devlog.hexops.com/>Hexops' devlog</a></p></div></div></body></html>
