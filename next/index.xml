Framebuffer coordinates: +Y down; (0, 0) is at the top-left corner. Texture coordinates: +Y down; (0, 0) is at the top-left corner. Diagrams (placeholder image) Why? You can use other coordinate systems if you need to, of course, by converting between them - but it intentionally won&amp;rsquo;t be as convienient to use with mach-math.</description></item><item><title>Examples - Mach core</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/core/examples/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/core/examples/</guid><description>.p-section { display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-top: 3rem; align-items: center; justify-content: center; } .p-section-highlight { margin-top: 4rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; } .p-section-right { margin-left: 2rem; } .p-section-left { margin-right: 2rem; } .p-img-left { height: 10rem; margin-left: 4.5rem; } .p-img-right { height: 10rem; margin-right: 4.5rem; } .p-logo { margin-right: 3rem; margin-top: 2rem; } .p-logoimg { height: 10rem; width: 100%; } h2 { text-align: left; margin-top: 0; } pre { max-width: 25rem; font-size: 12px; } @media (max-width:700px) { .</description></item><item><title>Experimental libraries - Mach</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/libs/experimental/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/libs/experimental/</guid><description>Experimental Zig gamedev libraries The following libraries are experimental. Some are not usable yet/we expect their APIs to change substantially, while others are near promotion to being declared stable but have a few caveats.
While libraries are unstable, they live in the Mach monorepo. Once declared stable they will be exported to a separate standalone repository.
mach-sysaudio mach-sysaudio is a lightweight and cross-platform abstraction over various sound drivers, providing input and output.</description></item><item><title>Getting started - Mach core</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/core/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/core/getting-started/</guid><description>Getting Started with Mach core Here you will learn how to use mach-core in your own project/repository. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, check out the examples as those describe how to actually use Mach core&amp;rsquo;s APIs, this page just describes project setup.
Mach is now using the Zig package manager Note: Mach has recently been updated to make use of the experimental Zig package manager, although it cannot yet be used for all our dependencies due to some bugs with it.</description></item><item><title>Known issues - Mach engine</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/about/known-issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/about/known-issues/</guid><description>Known issues If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to run the Mach examples or similar, you may be running into one of these known issues.
nixOS If you are using nixOS, we have tips on how to use Mach with it here.
Windows File not found If you encounter an error like this:
Windows does not have symlinks enabled, or Git is not configured to use them. This is very annoying and has been reported to Microsoft.</description></item><item><title>Mach Discord community</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/discord/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/discord/</guid><description>Redirecting you to https://discord.gg/XNG3NZgCqp

Column-major matrix storage Column-vectors (i.e. right-associative multiplication, matrix * vector = vector) The benefit of using this &amp;ldquo;OpenGL-style&amp;rdquo; matrix is that it matches the conventions accepted by the scientific community, it&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ll find in linear algebra textbooks. It also matches WebGPU, Vulkan, Unity3D, etc. It does NOT match DirectX-style which e.g. Unreal Engine uses.
Note: many people will say &amp;ldquo;row major&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;column major&amp;rdquo; and implicitly mean three or more different concepts; to avoid confusion we&amp;rsquo;ll go over this in more depth below.</description></item><item><title>Migration notes - Mach core v0.2 API redesign</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/core/migrations/2023-core-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/core/migrations/2023-core-api/</guid><description>mach-core: v0.2 API redesign Mach v0.2 brought a complete redesign of the mach-core API. To upgrade your application, see the notes below.
See also the migration notes page.
Updating your application Previously, a complete Mach Core application looked something like this:
pub const App = @This(); pub fn init(app: *App, core: *mach.Core) !void { // ... } pub fn deinit(_: *App, _: *mach.Core) void {} pub fn update(app: *App, core: *mach.</description></item><item><title>nixOS usage - Mach engine</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/about/nixos-usage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/about/nixos-usage/</guid><description>Using Mach on nixOS If you use nixOS and want to use Mach, this document is for you.
usage via nix-ld (preferred, requires unstable) Use nix-ld following e.g. this article.
For example this shell:
with import &amp;lt;nixpkgs&amp;gt; {}; mkShell { NIX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH = lib.makeLibraryPath [ pkgs.xorg.libX11 pkgs.vulkan-loader ]; NIX_LD = lib.fileContents &amp;#34;${stdenv.cc}/nix-support/dynamic-linker&amp;#34;; shellHook = &amp;#39;&amp;#39; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NIX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH &amp;#39;&amp;#39;; } Then running zig build as usual:

Sometimes newer versions will work, older versions almost never work due to occassional minor changes in the Zig standard library APIs.
Platform support We aim to support a broad array of operating systems and architectures, as long as they are reasonably used by desktop/mobile consumers, or someone would like to contribute and maintain support for them.</description></item><item><title>Project goals - Mach engine</title><link>https://machengine.org/next/about/goals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/next/about/goals/</guid><description>Mach project goals For the goals of our engine itself (i.e. how we see the process of game development changing), please see the Mach engine overview.
This page covers more broad project goals that apply to all Mach projects, code, standalone libraries, etc.
