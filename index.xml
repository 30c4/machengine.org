These aren’t Zig bindings to these libraries (which we have separately), but instead are just forks of the actual project with their build system replaced by build.zig so you can depend on them and build them using the Zig package manager.
Pure forks with build.zig:

We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Mach for ~2 years now, primarily building out the Zig gamedev ecosystem, building foundational packages that we needed for Mach core, and as a result we&amp;rsquo;ve really just broken ground on the engine side of things.
Development is fairly linear, but developments that you see aren&amp;rsquo;t linear, we were focused on more foundational things before - but today we&amp;rsquo;re actively focused on higher-level APIs which will have more profound impacts for end-users.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://machengine.org/about/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/about/faq/</guid><description>Frequently asked questions When will the engine be released? There won&amp;rsquo;t be one major event, rather it will be a bunch of small/incremental releases building up to it. You can look at the engine roadmap to get an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;re working on currently, and what will come later.
Can I use Mach to make a simple 2D game? Using the engine? Definitely not today.

As a result, errors must be handled asynchronously as well. try isn&amp;rsquo;t going to work here.
Error scopes WebGPU has a concept of error scopes, you can push an error scope onto the stack and pop an error scope.</description></item><item><title>GPU memory management</title><link>https://machengine.org/engine/gpu/memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/engine/gpu/memory/</guid><description>GPU memory management Reference counting GPU objects like gpu.Texture, gpu.Buffer, or any other object which has a .reference, .release and .destroy method - use reference counting.
Although we love explicit memory management, GPU memory is perhaps one of the best use-cases for reference counting. All WebGPU objects are reference counted, and it&amp;rsquo;s not just because it originated as a browser API.
Guidance Use .reference() and .release() to release memory of objects.</description></item><item><title>Known issues</title><link>https://machengine.org/about/known-issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/about/known-issues/</guid><description>Known issues If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to run the Mach examples or similar, you may be running into one of these known issues.
