# GPU error handling

## Asynchronous nature

GPUs have largely asynchronous APIs: you build up a command buffer which encodes a number of commands instructing the GPU to do something, and then you ask the GPU to execute that buffer of commands. As a result, errors must be handled asynchronously as well. `try` isn't going to work here.

## Error scopes

WebGPU has a concept of _error scopes_, you can push an error scope onto the stack and pop an error scope. Commands that produce errors while the error scope was on the stack will result in _that_ error scope's callback being invoked. Let's look at a concrete example:

### Catching a shader compilation error

```zig
// Push a validation error scope, so that if compiling the shader fails we'll
// be able to handle that error.
core.device().pushErrorScope(.validation);

// Compile our fragment shader.
var fs_module = core.device().createShaderModuleWGSL("my fragment shader", fragment_shader_code);

// Pop our error scope. If compilation fails then we'll get a callback.
var error_occurred: bool = false;
_ = core.device().popErrorScope(&error_occurred, struct {
    inline fn callback(ctx: *bool, typ: gpu.ErrorType, message: [*:0]const u8) void {
        if (typ != .no_error) {
            std.debug.print("ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´:\n{s}\n", .{message});
            ctx.* = true;
        }
    }
}.callback);
if (error_occurred) {
    // Our fragment shader failed to compile, so fallback to a different fragment shader.
    fs_module = core.device().createShaderModuleWGSL(
        "black_screen_frag.wgsl",
        @embedFile("black_screen_frag.wgsl"),
    );
}
defer fs_module.release();
```

## Debugging

### Naming objects

At many points, when creating an object there is a `label` parameter or field you can specify to _name an object_. This is very useful in debugging, as WebGPU error messages will include the error when pointing at e.g. pipeline validation errors.

### RenderDoc & other tools

You may wish to use [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) and [AMD Radeon GPU Profiler](https://gpuopen.com/rgp/) or [NVIDIA Visual Profiler](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-visual-profiler).
