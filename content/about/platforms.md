## Platform support

We aim to support a broad array of operating systems and architectures, as long as they are reasonably used by desktop/mobile consumers, or someone would like to contribute and maintain support for them.

## Console support

Console support is a goal <em>in future years</em>, but we're realistic this will not happen anytime soon.

Zig has a work-in-progress C backend, which enables Zig projects to compile themselves to C code which can then be compiled using a standard C compiler. We will leverage this in order to compile Mach games using console's official SDKs, when the time comes.

Our intention is for Hexops (game company) to offer private access to a set of _plugins_ that will enable console support/features, under all neccessary NDAs/legal agreements which console manufacturers require of partners and publishers. We are optimistic about offering this as an at-cost service, with no intention of making profits from it.
