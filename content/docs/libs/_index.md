# Mach standalone libraries

Mach provides a set of 100% standalone, high-quality Zig gamedev libraries on which it is built.

All of our libraries feature <a href="../../about/goals#zero-fuss-installation">zero-fuss installation</a>, <a href="../../about/goals#seamless-cross-compilation">cross-compilation</a> at the flip of a switch, and <a href="../../about/goals#platform-support">broad platform support</a>.

Although Mach is developed in a monorepo (one big repository), our stable libraries are provided in 100% separate repositories so you don't even have to download code you do not care about.

## Stable libraries

In the event that a major change is required to one of our stable libraries, we will provide details on how to upgrade in our [migration notes](../core/migrations.md).

* [mach/glfw](glfw) - perfected GLFW bindings for Zig

## Experimental

Experimental libraries may have their APIs change without notice.
