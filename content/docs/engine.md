# Mach engine: game engine & graphics toolkit

    We’re planning a fully-fledged set of deeply integrated tools, a proper editor, the whole deal-we’re not kidding around here.

    We're realistic in that we are a fair amount of time away from this being reality. We only want to speak once we really have something to show you that we know you'll love - so please wait to hear our voice.

## Modular

Mach engine is designed to be modular, the only part you must adopt is our Entity Component System (as all modules are built using this to integrate with one another.)

All modules will be optional, so that you can easily plug-and-play different ones for making GUIs, rendering 2D sprites, 3D meshes, physics & more.

## Data & tooling-driven

We envision a new set of tools for gamedevs that involve a deep integration with our ECS, which should allow for extensive debugging facilities and more. We're optimistic about exploring other tooling which effectively produce data in simple & intuitive ways (think: why is developing games not as fun as playing them?)

## Join the effort

There is a ton of stuff to do, and we'd love your help in making this a reality. :)
