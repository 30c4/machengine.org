Hexops was created by [Stephen Gutekanst](https://twitter.com/slimsag), who has thus far led [an arduous journey](https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/increasing-my-contribution-to-zig-to-200-a-month) into game development, spending 4 years learning about game engines full-time, 7 years [building developer tools](http://slimsag.com) and a thriving startup, [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com). Over the past few years he has been working double-time [writing code 100 hours/week](https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/I-write-code-100-hours-a-week) working towards executing on a self-funded 10 year game development vision.

## Where are we today?

Currently [Mach engine](/mach) is where almost all of my time goes, we're laying the groundwork for some future games at present. Development of Mach engine is full-time for me, around ~55h/week, with ad-hoc part-time contributions from others. I additionally hold a full-time position ~48h/week at [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com).

In the coming years, I anticipate shifting 100% of my time to Hexops and embarking on a self-funded 10-year journey to make some games. We're not there yet.

## Where are we going?

One of the reasons I chose to join a dev tools startup out of school instead of going into the gamedev industry is because that industry is so fundamentally broken. From companies like EA games\* edging towards quite literally getting children addicted to gambling, to companies like Telltale Games\* violating federal labor laws, to companies like Blizzard\* having rampant and systemic sexual harrasment in their DNA.

Feedback from players goes entirely neglected, or leads to empty promises from PR teams. There are pushes for DLC, pre-orders, and early-access games to drive profits. Quality suffers. Even Valve, my favorite game company, [neglects their games](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/ox3fv1/nobody_wants_to_play_an_arena_shooter_from_some/h7kqer6/) as their Steam marketplace dominance is more valuable than producing games.

Game companies are in a race to the bottom-we'd like to make this a race to the top by releasing games you _want_ to pay for.
